We had a few guests coming to see us in the evening and the Team led by Chamila took good care to ensure that all the minute details were taken care of. All of us had dinner at the Taprobane that night and Udaya and his colleague on duty, Chef Sudath and the Stewards were exceptional. Good work Boys. Keep it up. We will come again and again.

It was poor experience that I received from the point where I had to park the car. There is no indication as to where you have parking available in the basement and I was told the basement is reserved for staff but lower level is for customers. I was quite surprised to hear this. There was strangely a power outage for few minutes during our workshop and I was again surprised to notice that there was no back up power for sometime. My worst experience was the state of the washrooms as both ladies and gents wash rooms at the area (Angsana Spa) where we had our workshop was out of order. You have to walk a distance to find a wash room. The state of the wash rooms too were unacceptable for a five star hotel. Last but not least I was disappointed to notice the standard of the buffet laid out at the Taprobane restaurant. Food was lousy and tasteless. Sushi served in one corner looked stale and the sashimi definitely didn\u2019t look fresh. The food served near the cooking area was hard to reach and the chefs who were supposed to serve were too busy chit chatting... to get a roast lamb cut I had to stand and wait to get the chefs attention. By the time we went for lunch it was around 1.30 pm and I also noticed that half the dessert items were over at that time. When I asked if the desserts will be refilled the manager at the restaurant said yes. However till I walked out around 2 pm the dessert items were never refilled. I was quite disappointed to notice the large scale deterioration of service and quality of one of the best loved 5 star hotels in Colombo.","title":"Cinnamon Grand not grand anymore"},{"date":"2018-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I visited for business and stayed at the Executive Lounge at Cinnamon Grand.

The level of service was average; the check-in took about 20 min. However the hotel itself is perfect for a business trip. The rooms are clean and the hotel is perfectly located.

Restaurant Nuga Gama is recommendable if you want to try the local food.","title":"Great for a business trip"},{"date":"2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","text":"\"Great value for money\"Great taste food for comparatively very reasonable price.

There really is something for everyone.The first evening, we were served by the most genuine and polite young man named Davinda. His service was impeccable and his English was the most articulate that we had heard spoken in Sri Lanka. He was so quick to take our order, clear plates etc. The most impressive thing was that when we returned for our second visit, Davinda spotted us from accross the restaurant and made a special effort to come back and talk to us about our time in Sri Lanka. Davinda is an absolute credit to Hilton Hotel and I\u2019m sure he will do well in his hospitality career, he really was such a lovely young man.","title":"Absolutely brilliant - service fantastic"},{"date":"2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Buffet food in hotels can often be very depressing, noisy and lacking in style. Graze Kitchen is quite the opposite - very elegant surroundings and attentive waiting staff and most importantly beautiful food. A huge range of cuisines, but all delicious. I particularly appreciated the mini deserts - I could have several and not feel over full! Raspberry parfait was lovely. Perfect place to end our Sri Lankan trip before going to the airport for the late flight back to Melbourne.","title":"Great Buffet"},{"date":"2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","text":"We went to Graze Kitchen to celebrate my sister\u2019s birthday.

The vegetarian Indian food in particular was delicious. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming as we weren\u2019t staying in the hotel but came in just for food.

The reservation desk was nice enough to arrange a private dinning room which was nice as it gave us more privacy. Although it was a slight distance to the buffet table it was well worth it. We also had the pleasure of having Roshini Weerawickrema attending to all our requests at the table. She was very courteous and pleasant.The food too was great in terms of taste and variety was sufficient. The lamb carving station was a put off, while the sushi station could have improved on variety. The Chinese section was great. I was however unable to try out the Indian section as I had quite lot. The desserts section was good as there was a make your own ice cream counter is a must have for kids. I also liked the small individual portions of the puddings so you dont end up throwing half of it. The cakes sadly were little dry, the watalapam also could have been much better. Overall good presentation and ambiance.","title":"Lunch with a crowd of 13 on 8th July"},{"date":"2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Had the dinner buffet with my wife and two teenage daughters. There was a really nice variety of food to select from on the buffet. I really liked all the sushi, the Sashimi was excellent. The sushi chef is the same from Ikoi Tei. Also the shrimp cocktail and chilled crab was really nice. They had really nice lamb shwarma as well. I also tried some grilled squid which was great. I'm not a fan of Indian food but if you are, there are a lot of Indian options. The dessert selection was also excellent. In addition, the staff is really friendly and helpful. We had great service from Dileepa and Sudaraka. We will go back again.","title":"Great variety on the buffet"},{"date":"2018-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Yesterday night we ara going to graze kitchen.it is amazing place.the food was really good i love it so much .anyway dileepa is very kindly person he was very helpful for us.actually we like to come again that restaurant.","title":"It's gorgeous dinnerout"},{"date":"2018-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Wonderful n delicious foods.

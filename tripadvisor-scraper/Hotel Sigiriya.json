A nice uniformed English-speaking lady brought the key to room 22 and accompanied us to the room. A moment later, a man brought our bags.The room was clean and large enough for us. The wi-fi signal was good. We had no neighbor noise but we could hear conversations while in the bathroom which must have been connected through the vent system.We went to the terrace and ordered pineapple juice. After the drinks arrived, a monkey dashed down from the roof and stole the pineapple wedge on the rim of my glass. Later, I saw the chicken wire surrounding the main restaurant and I assume it is to keep the monkeys from carting off whole dinners.The buffet dinner was held in the large restaurant with two musicians playing local music. The buffet was ok but not great. I liked the ice cream in the dessert area.The buffet breakfast in the big restaurant was very good. I especially liked their chocolate croissants.The hotel provided complimentary room and board for our driver.Check out was easy and pleasant. An excellent value considering the location.","title":"An excellent value in Sigiriya"},{"date":"2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great location for climbing Sigiriya Rock and seeing wildlife (they regularly have wild elephants very close by).Restaurant is a little basic in presentation, but food was really good.Rooms are basic and simple (3* standard), but okay for a couple of days whilst on tour.The pool has great views, but be careful with children as surprising deep at one end!By the way, its well worth climbing the rock. But do it early in the day before the heat sets in and allow a couple of hours. The views are worth it.","title":"Great location, ideal for Sigiriya Rock and wildlife."},{"date":"2018-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great hotel, fine rooms, lovely pool with excellent view to Lion Rock.

We loved all the Sri Lankan food in the breakfast buffet (they also have a wide western selection if you prefer) and the freshly cooked omelets.Because we stayed four nights we even received a surprise invitation to have some free cocktails and canap\u00e9s one evening which we thought was a lovely touch.I would definitely recommend hotel Sigiriya and will hopefully be back again!","title":"Had an amazing time!"},{"date":"2018-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","text":"4 stars for Sri Lanka standards :)We stayed our first two nights in Sri Lanka at this hotel.

Housekeeping always say good morning when they pass and the restaurant staff (particularly Kamal) greeted us with a smile. Pool staff were great too - daughter got an insect bite and there was help on hand.Breakfast was tasty too; I will miss the egg hoppas.Location is good as well. Easy access to the cultural triangle and close to the village for meals.Grounds are pretty too and there is always that view from the pool :-)","title":"Beautiful Hotel Sigiriya"},{"date":"2018-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","text":"This hotel has nice and comfortable rooms near the old fortress.

The hotel was however a delight in itself with lovely large rooms, recently painted, a pool area which had a clear view of the fortress, a wonderful restaurant and relaxing bar area. A short walk away was a small area of tourist shops and a cafe. I would love to have spent another day just relaxing in the hotel grounds and walking to the nearby village shops.","title":"Wished we had stayed longer"},{"date":"2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Everything was great about this hotel. It was situated in an impressive acreage with birds and monkeys all around. The elephants roamed nearby, so that we saw several groups on the road at dusk as we returned to the hotel. The breakfast and dinner buffets at the restaurant were absolutely superb. Just wished that we had had more time to enjoy all that the resort offered.","title":"Lovely resort with great views of Sigiriya rock from the pool."},{"date":"2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","text":"It is a very nice hotel situated in Sigiriya jungle with a nice view of the Sigiriya rock. Very close to Sigiriya rock(1.3Kms)We booked two deluxe rooms. The rooms are all clean including the toilets. Rooms size is not that much big. But oky :) We are given in-room tea\/coffee making facilities, shower gel, shampoo towels. With A\/C, television and a mini bar. But no mosquito vaporisers. I believe that is highly important for a room in Sigiriya.Food, we booked from the menu (a la carte) as well we used the buffet. Menu contains mostly burgers, pasta, sandwiches and all. But for buffet you are getting international and Sri Lankan food too. They have a juice and alcohol bar. I believe that is quite expensive but they allow outside liquor with a corkage charge.The people and the service is awesome. People are very friendly and helpful. They welcome us with a nice welcome drink. I really appreciate that.Overall, I love the hotel which maintains the natural beauty as it is and hope the hotel management will get an action on mosquito problem in the room :)","title":"Eco-friendly hotel in Sigiriya"},{"date":"2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","text":"We spent one night here at Hotel Sigiriya and we had a great time. We booked two twin rooms with bed and breakfast option for a reasonable price (LKR 26,000).This hotel got the best view to the Sigiriya rock. In both rooms ,there were some space below the doors, so that helps bugs to come in to our rooms. That will be great if they can cover those spaces.They got limited options in their dinner menu, we got more western food selection. It will be great if they can add more local and Asian food choices in to the list. But the breakfast was so good and it got lot of variety.However , I can recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend a night or two around sigiriya.","title":"Amazing view !!!"}]

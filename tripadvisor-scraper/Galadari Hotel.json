Everything was accessible from hotel location.","title":"Central location"},{"date":"2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I can clearly see that it was a top hotel at one time, but it is definitely starting to slip. Lot of the finishes are more than a little worn and the rooms are short on the latest amenities. But, it does have a great location and their prices were reasonable.I did not find the staff to be particularly friendly or helpful.","title":"Fading glory"},{"date":"2018-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Stayed in this hotel as part of a custom made tour around Sri-Lanka. Flight got into Sri-Lanka at 4am so room wasn't ready (check in was at 2pm) so my tour guide arranged an early check in (an additional 40 dollars) Apart from initial problems as the bed linen not being changed and the toilet not flushing (consequence of an early check in I guess) the service I received was brilliant. Staff opening lift doors for me and my girlfriend, showing as around the facilities and just being generally nice and prompt. But the crowning jewel was the food..... Seriously the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet selection needs to be seen to be believed! Amazing choice and great tasting food. I have never seen such a spread in the many hotels I have frequented over the years! In addition the pool was pretty good, overlooking the parliament building in Colombo. All in all, a great experience just a tiny bit marred by my early check in.","title":"Food is ridiculously good"},{"date":"2018-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Have stayed at this hotel a few years ago and had good memories of this hotel but in this trip found this hotel to be very average. The only positive is that it is in a good location and friendly staff. However, the hotel facilities are quite poor. Rooms and facilities require a major overhaul. The air conditioning in the room was very bad. Overall a very average experience especially for the price paid.","title":"Colombo visit"},{"date":"2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","text":"The Galadari is a sort of every man's high tea. The food is something to run home and talk about, most of it is average, and none of it is bad. If you're just really hungry, there's the option of skipping lunch and just heading for this (we assume this is what most of the people here were doing, judging by the hordes), because essentially for Rs. 1800 you get to eat a lot of food. If you are a food lover and love to try various foods this will be a good place to you. Food is not Bad actually but we cant rate as superb.","title":"Galadari High Tea"},{"date":"2018-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","text":"TBH i didn't expect the dinner at Galadari would impress me this much.comparing with the 05 star hotel dinners this is something really good. The spread is good, good meat items + vegetarian items, which serves anyone. the price is all worth it.French Onion soup was a let down, which tasted like sini sambola water(Sinisambola is a Sri Lankan dish) but the cream soup was really good.Salad Bar - Had a pretty good selection. Im happy that they had smoked salmon. the beef salad was so good.Main course - Great! meat, pasta, rice, Sri Lankan style food, so many choices. the taste was surprisingly good. i had bits but i tasted.i honestly wish their dessert bar could improve a bit more. like chocolate mud cake would be nice. or they can improve their bread pudding.overall i think this is worth going for!","title":"Dinner Buffet!"},{"date":"2018-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","text":"We stayed here for two nights on the 16 & 17 August.The hotel is nice, rooms adequate however the buffet spread was the best of all the places we stayed. With such a wide spread it would have been nice to have clear marking of vegetarian and non vegetarian food as we had to keep asking all the time and since eggs are non vegetarian it was all the more challenging.The location of the hotel is quite strategic near the beach and the shopping is also just a few 100 meters away.Their tea shop has a wide variety of teas and at very reasonable prices. As a matter of fact their prices were significantly lower than some of the tea we purchased in the tea gardens that made us feel really cheated.","title":"Nice functional hotel"},{"date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"When there few weeks back with friends of mine and their high t is great.

The modern hotel is better than the water surroundings. It's nice to have a drink on the terrace along the road in front of you, but since China's reclamation of harbors is proceeding, we can not expect a sea of good view. I'm sorry.

The breakfast buffet was a good assortment of breads, fruits, local dishes were available everyday. The staff were attentive and friendly. There was a whole week of simultaneous conferences but they tried their best to respond to their guests needs. I was glad there was a Tea centre shop in the lobby, which solved our tea shopping needs, and the prices were same as malls including a 5% discount for checked in guests. The dutch hospital mall which had restaurants was a 2 minute walk. The room which we had a view of the beach.

I had high expectations about our stay as it was my fourth visit to this place and they always treated me well. When we arrived at the hotel nobody was there to receive us and we had to wait long hours in the lobby moreover They have n't served us a welcome drink which was included in our package. We booked one triple room with Sea view for a daily rate of $150 but they have allotted a double room and provided one extra bed which was unacceptable. After heated arguments with the manager, they have promised to give a triple room but they never fulfilled their promise. We had to stay all three days in that congested room having paid $150 per day which is a sizable amount. We had to ask multiple times for services like filling the tea\/ coffee sachets or cleaning the rooms etc. When we had a problem with the heater in the room we contacted the reception to fix it and no one turned up until we went to the reception and shouted at them. Overall we had a terrible experience and we won't stay in this place again.","title":"Disappointed !!"}]

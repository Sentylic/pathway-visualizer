We had the traditional vegetable curry 9 dish plus rice set and a fruit platter for pudding (all made suitable for us as vegans). Everything was delicious, authentic and natural. More than enough food was on offer and the prices and ludicrously inexpensive. Lovely staff and service and we even got a ride home to our hotel afterwards. Comfortable open walled restaurant. Lovely dinner thank you!",

Leaving the hotel by Tuk Tuk in the evening meant negotiating the roads at night and the elephants!!!! Quite an exhilarating ride but well worth it as the traditional Sri Lankan curry we ate here was really delicious. I recommend this restaurant highly if you are in the area for quality meals and friendly service. The chef and his wife both waited on our table and it was a lovely experience.",

The restaurant is run by a family, and we're informed that Rithu is the name of the daughter. All over the place is very clean and nice. The owners speak English and with them we spoke about Sri Lankan food. We ordered Sri Lankan food, chicken curry with rice and they had served the meal with a lot of side dishes which can be eaten as main meals too! The food is so delicious that I can't forget the taste. The sambal, the dhal, the curry with fresh coconut, the ocra, the pumpkin with curry sauce.....At the end they also served us fruit which was very fresh.... The service is very good and the owners very kind. The prices are very reasonable... Rithu is the best place to eat in Sigiraya.",

The eggplant, Dahl and an amazing dish of coconut and greens were particular highlights. The host thoughtfully brought a plate of fruit for dessert and offered us a lift home. We felt very welcome and highly recommend this place to visitors.",

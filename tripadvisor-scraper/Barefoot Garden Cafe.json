One should go here if you wanna just relax and chill with your friends.Overall, it is a great place. Very friendly staff. Excellent food and great service. I would say that it is one of the places that provide really tasty food in Colombo.Definitely i would visit again - but just make sure not to sit next to those Industrial fans which could blow your head right off :). But it was great.",

There were tourists and it is a bit more pricey than local cafes but it is a really nice experience and low price compared to Europe. I came to chat with friends and this was a great place for it. The shop in the front is something you have to see along with the fully functioning loom that was being used when we were there. It is also refreshing to not have to barter or argue with waiters when you are over-charged which is common in Sri Lanka. They are honest.",

The aroma as we came in the door was so delicious and inviting. The tables had simple authentic Sri Lankan touch amenities. We order some falafel warp and drinks but as I am living in Middle East, I never thought that they will serve delicious falafel same as the Arab countries. The food is really tasty and well prepared.Service was attentive and friendly. Refills of water were frequent and staff removed empty plates without disrupting the conversation. The restaurant is both quaint and small but patrons seemed to have space for comfortable conversation. The building next to restaurant itself giving an authentic look where they sell handcraft items. This restaurant is worth the visit.",

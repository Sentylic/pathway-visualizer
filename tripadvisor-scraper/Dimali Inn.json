We took a tuk tuk from Weligama Bay to try this restaurant out and we were not disappointed. When we arrived we were shown through to the back area in the garden of the restaurant where they quickly placed a plastic table and chairs for us to sit at. This restaurant is run by a husband and wife team. The husbands takes the orders and his wife expertly cooks your meals. When you sit out the back you can watch as the lady prepares your food. The chicken curry with vegetables and rice was fabulous. The cucumber curry, eggplant, mixed vegetables and off course coconut sambal which were the vegetable part of the dish were delicious. Yes the service may be a little slow but it is well worth the wait and very reasonably priced also. The lady who cooked our meal came over to make sure everything was to our liking and we assured her it was. We highly recommend that you give this little restaurant a go.","title":"A family run restaurant and a great place to eat"},{"date":"2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Excellent local food,I am enjoyed that local food ,is nice I am recommend that place enjoy .thank you, Dimali inn.....!","title":"Best rice and curry \u201cMirissa \u201c"},{"date":"2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Really delicious home made local food.

We ordered pineapple juice, mixed juice, egg kottu and two veg curries with rice. Then the family jumped into action and started chopping things and cooking things. The kottu was just brilliant. It was all FANTASTIC! They asked how spicy we liked things and then brought us some chilli sauce on the side. We had aubergine curry (sticky and sweet), okra curry and dahl and a freshly cooked super puffy pappadom. So pleased we chose to go there. It was great value too!","title":"Absolutely delicious!!"},{"date":"2018-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I got the recommendation for this from my sister who ate here a couple of years back.

Once you walk through you're in a families garden and it's really lovely and homely. They're such nice people and all do the cooking together. The food was delicious and a big portion (I couldn't finish it all) would have gone back if we had found it earlier. Thank you for a lovely meal x","title":"Really pleased we walked through to the back"}]

This is our go-to place for flavorful meals.We usually like to order things simple like jasmine rice and a green or red curry along with tamarind juice or maybe tom yum and pad thai.We open heartedly recommend their food.Ps- They do add lot of lemongrass and peanuts for certain dishes so if you have any allergies, you can always tell them to exclude these.",

Simple decor with views of the adjacent tennis court.We ordered a thai green curry chicken, kankun???, Buttered cuttlefish, this pork, egg fried rice.The cuttlefish dish has mostly carrots and peppers.(see pic) The green Thai curry did not have many chicken pieces though the liquid was plenty and tasty. The pork was tasty and adequate.We spent about SLR 4500.00 which is about \u00a325.00. So not cheap and similar price as Wagamamas.",

Small menu- of course it had many items but they all fell into a few recipes.Food had a stronger flavor than the original Thai cooking- bent towards Sri Lankan preferences.

Waiter didn't exhibit that much of excitement about having customers (even if we were only customer at that point) or didn't seem to be proud of serving.Ambient was nice.",

I live in Malaysia where Thai food is fairly commonplace but can safely say the meal at quick thai beats anything I've had in Malaysia. Service was great and the ambiance relaxed. Highly recommended and great value for money. Check it out if you love Thai food.",

Perfect set menus for work lunches. Id recommend the fried rice with basil chicken though the deep fried egg with it tends to be overdone and quite unappealing. I ask for a less fried egg and theyre happy to oblige. The coconut chicken soup is rich but tasty and the chicken noodles are a total crowd pleaser. A solid three stars! Just get that egg changed!",

Dining area is nice and clean.Their menu is very interesting and the food is really delicious also they are actually using Thai ingredients.Nevertheless I personally appreciate their service.One can enjoy their Thai meals at the place or can take away. Meals come with different kinds of juices and soft drinks.But it would be nice if one can enjoy a beer with some hot Thai food.8\/10 cheers!",

Selected \"Quick Thai\" to fulfill that dream!For a dinner outing the location was good even though it faces quite a busy street during the day time. Cool and comfortable. Ambience was all right. However, the menu could not offer any thing that we felt special to make this restaurant stand out from the other Thai restaurants in town. In fact what we noticed was a mixture of Thai and \"Sri lankanised\" Chinese style dishes in the menu. It causes confusion, as in some Chinese restaurants too we have observed familiar names in the menu to identify what they call Chinese dishes. May be Quick Thai prepares it in the Thai way.We were able to select some to flavour but there again a mistake that had occurred some where after the order was given deprived us from comparing the taste of the noodle based version against the rice based version of what we ordered as both items had been prepared with rice. In general, the dishes we tasted were all right.",

Now for some this would be a reasonable price but if You've had a meal here, seen what we ordered, tasted what we had then you know this is a MAJOR rip off.Food sucked. Tasted like someone had split a bottle of sugar into the food. Everything was super sweet. No need for dessert. Staff did not understand the basics of writing down an order.Took 40mins for drinks to arrive and 1hr and 5 mins for the food arrive. Server first served the Pad Thai, Spicy Rice and Sticky Rice. We were so hungry that we had eaten it all by the time they brought the Red and Green pork curry.Pad Thai had random strips of Chicken and the Red\/Green curry maybe had 3 pieces of pork per bowl and a whole lot of green peas.Since there was someone in our party celebrating their birthday we had a cake brought from outside. To go with this we decided to order ice cream. Somehow the server managed to screw up the order and when he finally got around to serving it was with Plastic spoons.From the whole ordeal the worst things for me is that the cutlery was...... UNWASHED. 5 of us got spoon that were previously used and unwashed. Still had curry from the previous meal.We payed way to much for what we received. Much better Thai places in Colombo where the price is less and the food is good but Quick Thai is absolutely definitely not one of them.",

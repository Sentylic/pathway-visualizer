Ideal place for a casual meal.","title":"Casual"},{"date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","text":"The food took about an hour to come 1\/2 hour for the waiter to take the order, he was in such a hurry, the food was amazing though the tom yum had a tad bit too much salt.The place looks like your average normal Chinese place.","title":"Bad experience"},{"date":"2017-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I don\u2019t mind spending lavishly when eating something really good. Their restaurants at Mount Lavinia and Nugeogoda did serve good cuisine for lunch and dinner. But yesterday we ordered and delivered some takeaways from the Mt Lavinia branch (bill around Rs 1319 \u2013 refer to the photo) ordering a standard portion of vegetable chop suey rice and pork in black bean sauce. That pork in black bean sauce was nothing, but an eye wash. Small chunks of pork heavily supplemented with capsicum and onions. Also the sauce was so diluted such it was like water and being brown in color. The black bean sauce that I have seen from good quality Chinese restaurants in Sri Lanka and elsewhere is somewhat viscous and darker in color. They should rename this dish as \u201cpork with capsicum and onion in black water sauce\u201d.It is very sad that in Sri Lanka there are plenty of restaurants whose takeaways are somewhat expensive by Sri Lankan standard (many often with good names), but serve absolute rubbish thereby cheating the customer.","title":"Takeaways: Absolute Rubbish"},{"date":"2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Been here so many times... good chinese food at very reasonable prices. No wonder the place is always packed with diners. They have got the tormula right... They also deliver all over the area.","title":"Great value for money"},{"date":"2017-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","text":"We had visited this place from office for a lunch.

The place was little gloomy at first glance. later with more people coming in it got better. The food we asked, we told them to make it extra spicy. So it was up to our expectation. tho Dice chicken dish was really good, the Hot butter cuttle fish was really crispy. Service was not exceptional but alright. Can recommend however.","title":"Chinese food that is spicy"},{"date":"2016-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Good place for a meal . The boss is very polite .

But unfortunately the quality of their foods are getting worse and service also not upto their reputed level.though the portions of food are large, the food is oily and their soups are not tasty at all.last time I tried their mixed grill which was a quite a large portion and had a good variety. their small rice portions can easily be shared by two.Waiters are friendly but not properly trained to give a proper service specially with providing necessary cutlery and things","title":"Average food and loosing its ambiance drastically"},{"date":"2016-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I normally visit to Nawala branch. Good place to be with family or with friends. If you are going for a drink the best place to be is at black out. You can have a peaceful drink and awesome foods. If you need to have a family dine in you can go to upstairs resturant where there is enough space and peace for a family dine in. Their food is delicious and the service is very good with friendly waiters. You can take away also. Price is also competitive all around I have pleasant experience every time I visit","title":"Nice place to drink and dine"},{"date":"2016-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I have been to this place with my girlfriend for a lunch.

The drinks are NOT good (the juices etc). The service has also been been at an okay standard with more room to improve. Recently called to order a delivery and they said it will take 1 1\/2 hours to send someone over - which was quite annoying, but at least they were upfront about it.. So we ended up driving here and picking it up.","title":"Nothing exceptional.

However though the quantity is good it was definitely not up to their usual standard. The salad accompanying it was good. They obviously had stinted on the Kafir lime so there was very little flavour of that and it was too sweet.It was like they just added a little chillie to the green curry and called it Red currybuck upSteam Boat I have ordered many times from you so i know you have the ability to improve.","title":"ordered take away not up to their usual standard"},{"date":"2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","text":"If you need to have a chill out drink with a friend this is the best place.
